            <p class="lead">UCSD gave me the chance to gain insights on user experience for mobile music apps. My team interviewed several people about their preferences and opinions on musics apps such as Spotfiy, Soundcloud, and Pandora, and also recorded walkthroughs of their actions in the app. We then gathered all the data and look for the pattern in the way the users operated the music app for specific action. Then we created user scenarios to help us simulate how a good redesign of the app would be like. </p>
            <p class="lead">Click <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k0XU4yKyPB7ytZhwKmSw7w4nkdO7bsp-lhtM4Q17bxo/edit?usp=sharing" target="#">here</a> to view the interviews we conducted and the user scenarios were came up with. The follow data also show comparative scenarios between how different music apps are used.</p>
            <p class="lead">After doing substantial research on the user expereinces in numerous different music apps such as Spotify, Soundcloud, and Apple Music, we redesgined and created our own layout of the ideal mobile music app. First, we had to brainsotrm for a significant while about how an ideal app should operate and look like. Then we used the software Axure to photoshop and design the layout. The process of the project waas painstakingly time-consuming but extremely rewarding. </p>
             <p class="lead">Here are the walkthroughs of two scenarios I made on the Invision website: <a href="https://invis.io/T56FXGCV8" target="#">Playlist Creation</a> and <a href="https://invis.io/6K6FXH24Q" target="#">Adding a new song to a playlist.</a> </p>

            <p class="lead">I learned many OOP lanagues in UCSD such as Java, C++, and Python. Object Oriented Programming allowed me to explore the potential of software engineering in innovation and optimization. Through encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, and abstraction, there are countless things you can do to create new technologies.</p>

            <p class="lead">Another important thing I learned in UCSD is the importance of teamwork. No matter how smart one individual is, one cannot succeed without collaboration and communication. In many team projects, I had the chance to be a key player and also a team player who made sure every team member utilizes his or her skills to contribute to the project.</p>
