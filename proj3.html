            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Taking COGS187A in UCSD gave me the chance to gain insights on user experience for mobile music apps. My team interviewed several people about their preferences and opinions on musics apps such as Spotfiy, Soundcloud, and Pandora, and also recorded walkthroughs of their actions in the app. We then gathered all the data and look for the pattern in the way the users operated the music app for specific action. Then we created user scenarios to help us simulate how a good redesign of the app would be like. </p>
            <p class="lead">Click <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k0XU4yKyPB7ytZhwKmSw7w4nkdO7bsp-lhtM4Q17bxo/edit?usp=sharing" target="#">here</a> to view the interviews we conducted and the user scenarios were came up with. The follow data also show comparative scenarios between how different music apps are used.</p>
            <p class="lead">After doing substantial research on the user expereinces in numerous different music apps such as Spotify, Soundcloud, and Apple Music, we redesgined and created our own layout of the ideal mobile music app. First, we had to brainsotrm for a significant while about how an ideal app should operate and look like. Then we used the software Axure to photoshop and design the layout. The process of the project waas painstakingly time-consuming but extremely rewarding. </p>
             <p class="lead">Here are the walkthroughs of two scenarios we made on the Invision website: <a href="https://invis.io/T56FXGCV8" target="#">Playlist Creation</a> and <a href="https://invis.io/6K6FXH24Q" target="#">Adding a new song to a playlist.</a> </p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Creating a
                <span class="text-muted">Redesign</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Numerous hard decsions had to be made because it was not possible to create "perfect" music app. We then uploaded the design in Axure up to a website called Invision where we could make specific regions of the design clickable and linkable to another image. Thus, we were able to create a walkthrough of our newly redesigned app. </p>
            <p class="lead">Over the course of our design, the first and most immediate difficult decision we had to make concerned the layout of the homepage. At first, we compared the screenshot steps of each platform in order to find a layout for reference that would best support our second scenario, which requires the more specific step of searching by artist. We initially thought that Spotify was the most complicated out of the three due to the large number of actions it had, so we eliminated Spotify and narrowed our options down to iTunes and SoundCloud. However, when we looked into them in further details, we observed that despite of their shorter walkthroughs, their layouts actually made the apps less user-friendly than Spotify. For example, on iTunes, there isn’t a place that allows the user to search or browse by genre or artist; similarly, on SoundCloud, there isn’t a more organized way to find songs by artist other than doing a manual lookup in the search bar.</p>
            <p class="lead">Therefore, we eventually went back to referencing Spotify’s homepage, which has a more systematic organization of information, such as the sidebar that contains the user’s private record like “playlist” and “history”, and everything else more general like “top songs”, “artists”, and “genres” displayed on the main page. This way, the user’s personal space can be separated from the public page that offers less specific functions. The user may choose to target a particular artist or genre in their existing library that can be accessed from the sidebar, or browse a new one from the homepage. Although such a layout results in more walkthrough steps, it is more efficient in terms of the usability for our second scenario.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Decisions</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Although such a layout results in more walkthrough steps, it is more efficient in terms of the usability for our second scenario. 
            The second difficulty we faced was color scheme, which was more of a secondary concern. One similarity that most platforms – YouTube, Spotify, iTunes, or SoundCloud – share is the simplicity of background colors. We noticed that the apps we looked at were all very simplistic in color. For instance, Spotify is presented in majorly green and black across the entire platform, while YouTube and iTunes are in red and white and SoundCloud in orange and white. With a more limited use of colors, the visual experience is more comfortable and less distracting. As a result, we decided to conform to the common practice and go with white and grey for the background, and a bright orange for the top cover of the homepage, just to define and emphasize our character a little more. Having one or two plain colors and just a dash of some louder one makes our app look overall more consistent and fun yet not overly flamboyant.</p>
            <p class="lead">The last decision we had to make was adding the ‘+’ icon to represent the “add a playlist” function. In the progress of designing, we originally had the ‘+’ sign for adding a playlist as “Add a playlist” because we wanted to be straightforward but having a long text like that ended up taking too much space and making the user interface messy and aesthetically unpleasing. Thus we replaced the text with a simple ‘+’ instead to save space and clean up the look. Even without the text, the purpose of ‘+’ is still pretty self-explanatory so there really was no need to textually explain that it’s for adding a playlist.</p>
